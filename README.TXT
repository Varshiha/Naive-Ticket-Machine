It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.
Part II: Naive ticket machine:
2. The value that is returned when I got the machine's balance after it printed the ticket was 0. In fact, I put 500 and after printing it went back to 0. 
3. The number in getBalance kept increasing as I was adding money. After I printed a ticket and there was 1425 in my getBalance, when I went back in was 0 again. I am assuming it didn't refund me. It still pprinted a ticket when i only put 200 and there was only 200 in my getBalance.
5. The only that is different is the price number. For example instead of saying 1000 cents, it says 30 cents.
6. I think it will look like this: public class Student and public class LabClass
7. It does matter how we write it because it showed red lines and the name of the changed to public TicketMachine. I think it does show what is wrong. We see red on the side where the numbers are showing which lines are wrong. 
8. It is possible to take out the public.
9. When we take the word class it shows error when I try to compile it.
